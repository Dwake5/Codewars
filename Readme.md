This is a repository of my codewars solutions.

I have been doing a lot of codewars problems in the last week. 
Users start at 8 kata and progress down to 1 kata and then back up to 8 Dan.

I find the site to be flawed in that problems are given a point value which increases with the difficulty assigned to it. Users can add problems and the community decides collectively on a rating. A user could continuosly do very simple 8 kata problems and get to a high level. They should find a way to avoid this.

The website gives you problems outside of your difficulty range to keep you learning and challenged. 

I have found that 7 and 8's are very easy for me, 6 and 5's are a good difficulty and 4's are a challenge. 

You can only read others solutions after you have created one. Once I have submitted a solution I look through other peoples, they are rated in two concurrent categories "Best practice" and "Clever", once at a sufficient coding profficiency it is productive to read others code. 

It also gives me an insight into code that is unique and niche and code that is industry standard. Because even if you can make your code as concise and clever as possible this is often not recommended as the three key principles of writing code are: 
Make it work
Ensure other developers/future you can read it
Optimise its (O) complexity

I will not be posting problems on difficulty of 7 and 8 here, because they are too easy and not at all an accurate decription of my skill.
